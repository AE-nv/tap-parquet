This Singer tap was created using the [Singer SDK](https://gitlab.com/meltano/singer-sdk).

## About Parquet

## Getting Started

- [ ] As a first step, you will want to scan the entire project for the text "`TODO:`" and complete any recommended steps.
- [ ] `TODO:` Once you have a boilerplate prepped, you'll want to setup Poetry and create the virtual environment for your project:

    ```bash
    pipx install poetry
    poetry install
    ```

- [ ] `TODO:` You can test out your new CLI directly with:

    ```bash
    poetry run tap-parquet --help
    ```


_`TODO: Remove the above section once complete.`_

## Testing Guide

Create tests within the `tap_parquet/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
